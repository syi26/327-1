Please write the NetIDs of your group members:

* NetID: ...
* NetID: ...
* NetID: ...
* NetID: ...

Revise this [tests.Rmd](tests.Rmd) file to answer the questions
below. Include reasonable labels (titles, axis labels, legends, etc.)
with each graph. Please use **boldface** (by enclosing text in `**
... **`) when writing your answers so that we can find them easily.

At the end of class, one person from each group should submit a
completed copy of this file. (Please don't submit multiple copies.)

We'll grade this exercise by opening your "tests.Rmd" file, clicking
"Knit HTML", and reading the output. We'll assign points as follows:

* No submission: 0/5
* Poor work: 3/5
* Good work: 5/5 (even if incomplete--there's more to do here than can be done in 75 minutes)

### John Wayne

(From p. 166 of Whitlock & Schulter's *The Analysis of Biological Data*)

In 1956, John Wayne played Genghis Khan in a movie called *The
Conqueror*. The movie was filmed downwind of 11 above-ground nuclear
bomb tests. Of the 220 people who worked on this movie, 91 had been
diagnosed with cancer by the early 1980s, including Wayne, his
co-stars, and the director. (Wayne died of cancer in 1979.) According
to large-scale epidemiological data, only about 14% of people of this
age group, on average, should ahve been stricken with cancer within
this time frame. Are these data strong evidence for an increased
cancer risk for people associated with this film? Run and analyze an
appropriate test.

```{r}
n = 220
x = 91
p = 0.14
prop.test(x, n, p)
# After performing the test we could see that the p-value is very small and the estimated probability is 0.41 which is a lot more than the hypothesis. So these data are strong evidence showing an increased cancer risk for people associated in this film.

### Repetitive Stress Injuries

(From p. 367 of Devore's *Probability and Statistics for Engineering
and the Sciences*)

Musculoskeletal neck-and-shoulder disorders are all too common among
office staff who perform repetitive tasks using computers. The article
"Upper-Arm Elevation During Office Work" (Ergonomics, 1996: 1221-1230)
reported on a study to determine whether more varied work conditions
would have any impact on arm movement. The accompanying data was
obtained from a sample of $n=16$ subjects.  Each observation is the
amount of time, expressed as a proportion of total time observed,
during which arm elevation was below 30$^{\circ}$. The two
measurements from each subject were obtained 18 months apart. During
this period, work conditions were changed, and subjects were allowed
to engage in a wider variety of work tasks.

Subject    |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8
-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Before     | 81 | 87 | 86 | 82 | 90 | 86 | 96 | 73
After      | 78 | 91 | 78 | 78 | 84 | 67 | 92 | 70

Subject    |  9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16
-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Before     | 74 | 75 | 72 | 80 | 66 | 72 | 56 | 82
After      | 58 | 62 | 70 | 58 | 66 | 60 | 65 | 73


```{r}
before <- c(81, 87, 86, 82, 90, 86, 96, 73, 74, 75, 72, 80, 66, 72, 56, 82)
after <- c(78, 91, 78, 78, 84, 67, 92, 70, 58, 62, 70, 58, 66, 60, 65, 73)
boxplot(before, after, names = c("before", "after"))
# We could use a boxplot to check the differences in quantiles and means between two data set.
```

Do the data suggest that true average time during which elevation is
below 30$^{\circ}$ differs after the change from what it was before
the change? Run and analyze an appropriate test.

```{r}
t.test(before, after, paired = TRUE)
# The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the two means between two data sets, since the p-value is very small, we could reject the null hypothesis. So, we could say that the data suggest that true average time during which elevation is below 30 degrees differs after the change from what is was before the change.

### Influence of music on wine purchases

The file
[wine.csv](http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~jgillett/327-1/graphics/wine.csv)
contains data on wine purchased from a liquor store. Each row
corresponds to a bottle of wine purchased. The first column indicates
which type of music was playing in the store during the purchase. The
second column indicates which type of wine was purchased. Paste your
graph from the group work on graphics that gives evidence about the
question of whether type of music and type of wine are independent.

```{r}
myfile = read.csv(url("http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~jgillett/327-1/graphics/wine.csv"))
plot(myfile$French, myfile$French.1, xlab = "Type of Music", ylab = "Type of Wine", main = paste0("The Relationship Between Music and Wine"))
# They are not independent since more people tend to buy French wine after listening to French music, and more people tend to buy German wine after listening to German music.
```

Are these data strong evidence that music played and wine purchased
are not independent? Run and analyze an appropriate test.

```{r}
myfile$French = factor(myfile$French, levels = c("French", "German"), labels = c(0, 1))
myfile$French.1 = factor(myfile$French.1, levels = c("French", "German"), labels = c(0, 1))
tbl = table(myfile$French, myfile$French.1)
chisq.test(tbl)
# The null hypothesis is that the music played and the wine guests ordered are independent with each other. Since the p-value is very small, we could reject the null hypothesis. So, we could say that the data suggest that the music played and the wine guests ordered have certain relationship and are not independent.
```

### Plants

Look at the built-in data frame `CO2`. Describe the data set (in
English and the kind of language used in an introductory statistics
course, not in R language). Mention whether it's from an experiment or
an observational study and mention which are independent/explanatory
variables and which are dependent/response variables.

Make a graph that helps with comparing the distribution of uptake for
the two grasses, Quebec and Mississippi.

```{r}
Qub <- CO2[which(CO2$Type == "Quebec"),]
Mis <- CO2[which(CO2$Type == "Mississippi"),]
boxplot(Qub$uptake, Mis$uptake, names = c("uptake in Quebec", "uptake in Mississippi"))
# ...
```

Are these data strong evidence that the population mean uptake for
Quebec grass is different from the population mean uptake for
Mississippi grass? Run and analyze an appropriate test.

```{r}
t.test(Qub$uptake, Mis$uptake)
# The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the mean uptake between grass in Quebec and grass in Mississippi. Because the p-value shown by t-test is very small, we should reject the null hypothesis. So, the population mean uptake for Quebec grass is different from the population mean uptake for Mississippi grass.
```

Find a 99% confidence interval for the difference between the true
mean uptake for Quebec grass and the true mean uptake for Mississippi
grass.

```{r}
t.test(Qub$uptake, Mis$uptake, conf.level = 0.99)
# As shown, the confidence interval is (7.593543, 17.725505)
```
